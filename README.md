# Hanes-Case-Study Competition

## Background
The concept of ridesharing has disrupted the transportation industry over the past decade.  Companies like Uber and Lyft have captured a large part of the taxicab business and significantly changed the way that people view transportation.  Instead of hailing a taxi at the airport, passengers will order a ride with Uber or Lyft from their phone with the benefit of knowing who will pick them up, when and where they will be picked up and how much the ride will cost.  This differs from hailing a taxi because the cost is not known until you arrive at your destination and you do not have as much information about the person providing the transport.  On the other hand, taxicabs are better regulated than ridesharing and often have oversight and accountability that can be found lacking in the rideshare industry.
New York City taxicabs have been significantly affected by ridesharing (Marketwatch).  However, NYC has recently initiated some congestion charges and limits on the number of rideshare vehicles that are permitted in the city to help alleviate congestion (Wired).  These have not been viewed favorably by the rideshare companies but the taxicabs are hopeful that they may see a rebound in their volume.
New York City has two major taxicabs.  Yellow cabs that only accept rides by being hailed by someone, and Green cabs that are primarily “for hire” cabs which pick up by reservation.  There are also some street restrictions associated with the type of taxicab (Quora). 
New York City provides open data for its taxis and has large files of data available by year since 2009.  The data is separated by yellow and green taxis and can be found here:  https://data.cityofnewyork.us/browse?q=taxi

## Case Study Assignment
For this case study, select an area to analyze using all or just a subset of the taxi data from New York City.  Supplementary data sources may also be used if they are relevant and sources are provided. The area selected should reflect a relevant business problem for the taxicab industry.  
You should prepare a 10 minute presentation that includes the following:
•	Business problem that you are exploring / the question that you are answering
•	Analytic approaches that you used to explore the problem
•	Outcomes/results of the analysis
•	Recommendations and/or next steps resulting from the outcome
All 3 team members must be involved in the presentation and throughout the project.  The case studies will be evaluated by faculty and staff from the OBAIS Department and the winning team will be selected to participate as the representative of the University of Cincinnati in the Hanes Analytics Case Competition (HACC) at the University of Tennessee in April.  The 2nd place team will stand as a runner up in case the winner is unable to attend the competition.
